   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and ensure they follow our coding standards:
   - Code is formatted with ruff
   - All tests pass
   - New features include tests
   - Documentation is updated if needed

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Run pre-commit checks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

5. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .

## Code Style

This project uses:
- **Ruff** for code formatting and linting (replaces Black, isort, and flake8)
- **Pyright** for static type checking

Pre-commit hooks will automatically check and format your code before each commit.

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Use pytest for testing
- Aim for high test coverage

Run tests with:
```bash
pytest
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=src/{{ cookiecutter.package_name }} --cov-report=html
```

Check code with ruff:
```bash
ruff check src/{{ cookiecutter.package_name }}
ruff format src/{{ cookiecutter.package_name }}
```

Check type coverage:
```bash
pyright src/{{ cookiecutter.package_name }}
```

Check docstring coverage:
```bash
docstr-coverage src/{{ cookiecutter.package_name }} --skip-magic --skip-init
```

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any changed functionality
- Add docstrings to all public functions, classes, and modules
- Use the NumPy docstring style
- Build docs locally to verify changes:
  ```bash
  cd docs
  make html
  ```

## Pull Request Guidelines
